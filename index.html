	<p>My Favorite vacation was my trip to San Francisco. San Francisco is a beautiful city with great weather. The sights are outstanding and worth the visit. The best way to see the city is to ride the trolley. The trolley will take you past many famous places and makes stops along the way. The trolleys are very famous and an iconic part of San Franciscan life. The trip down the hills of the town are exhilarating, and inspiring.</p>

	<p>The best part of my vacation to San Francisco was my trip to Alcatraz. Exploring the old prison was very interesting and informative. Learning about all the different groups that claimed the island or had occupied it taught me that Americans dont think about who may have owned something before they did. The old prison even had an audio tour that gave the history of the fort as you walked through it. </p>

	<p>When you go to San Francisco the one thing that everyone has to do is drive across the Golden Gate Bridge. The bridge is not golden obviously. It is red because the metal used rusted and formed the iconic bridge seen today.  The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge and is in the Oakland Bay. The same body of water as Alcatraz Island, do not confuse the Golden Gate Bridge with the Richmond Steele Bridge. </p>

	<p>The architecture of San Francisco is also amazing. The houses seem to roll down the hills like they were there naturally. They seem so close together that there is no choice other than to be friends with your neighbor. The houses look like they were all made from the same mold and painted individually. It is truly a beautiful sight to behold. San Francisco is a very beautiful city. </p>

	<p>The Food in San Francisco is also wonderful. There are many different nationalities represented in the city and they all offer several types of food. The city doesnt just look good it smells good too. The smell of Chinese food from the Chinese district and the smell of fresh spaghetti form the Italian area in short the city is delicious. </p>
